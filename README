vast-maxmind is a node wrapper for the maxmind GeoIP location service.   It leverages the Maxmind C API which you should download and install from here before starting to use this module.

This first iteration is limited functionality

 - Supports the City data:  [http://www.maxmind.com/app/geolitecity][2]
 - Only supports lookup by IP address.  Named hosts and more features will likely come later (time permitting)

Please check out the tests folder for the demo.  


    var VastMaxmind = require('../build/Release/vastmaxmind').VastMaxmind,
      vmm = new VastMaxmind('/usr/local/share/GeoIP/GeoIPCity.dat'),
    	addr = "8.8.8.8";
    
    var foo = vmm.location(addr, function(data) {
    	console.log(JSON.stringify(data) );
    	process.exit();
    });
